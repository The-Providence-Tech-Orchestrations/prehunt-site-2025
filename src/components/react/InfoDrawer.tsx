          <DrawerTitle>WHAT IS THIS?</DrawerTitle>
          <DrawerDescription>MIT Mystery Heist was written as a recruiting tool to help increase the number of MIT students interested and involved in MIT Mystery Hunt. The plot acts as a precursor to MIT Mystery Hunt 2025 but does not contain spoilers, content, or answers related to the Hunt.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Mystery Heist was released to MIT students on October 14th and will be made public on <b className="text-white blur-[0.5px]">November 16th at noon ET</b>.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Because this isn't a true hunt, there will be no team registration or leaderboards. You may check your answers on this site, and all solutions will be published immediately.

          <DrawerTitle>HUNT LENGTH & DIFFICULTY LEVEL</DrawerTitle>
          <DrawerDescription>This hunt is composed of 12 puzzles, including 2 metas and 1 supermeta. It was written for teams of ~4 people who may or may not have puzzling experience. The puzzles are meant to be solved using no tech other than phones and in no more than 6 hours. Puzzle difficulty is similar to Star Rats, BAPHL, or DASH.
          <br></br><br></br>
          There are Expert and Casual versions of this hunt. The puzzles are mostly identical, but Casual versions typically have more flavor text or additional helpful instructions.
